1) bearing-headplate
part file for the headplate with empty seats
this is for attaching bearings, such as stainless steel 
or ruby bearings

2) dust-cap
dust cap, add magnets (K&J B4201) for attaching to
implanted animals to protect their implanted windows
attach the magnets to the corners of the triangle
.STL version for 3D printing

3) machined-headplate
part file for the headplate with machined half spheres

4)mount-b662-90-rev3
mount part file, uses magnets (K&J B662-N52)
when attaching magnets, be careful to attach one magnet
at a time, and leaving it to dry. I suggest using loctite
and an accelerator, such as zip-kicker, in a fume hood to
attach them at first. upon being sure the magnets are in
a good spot for the headplate, then use structural epoxy.

it is difficult to remove the structural epoxy once it is
attached; if users want to be able to remove the magnets
after use, I would strongly suggest using loctite

magnets should be as close to the center aperature as
possible
magnet seats in the mount have a little extra room, in
case users want to size up the magnets


5) mouse-voluntary-box folder
5.1) boxdrawingdim
dimensions of a behavioral box for mouse voluntary head
fixation. this box's height is the approximate height of
a mouse, which allows for consistent animal height
while the animal is in the chamber (no rearing, etc.)

one side of the box has a sliding entry door, while the
other side has a corridor. there are no walls to this 
smaller corridor because we add a 3D printed hallway

5.2) hallway
part file for a hallway with guides for the animal to raise
its head and slide it in underneath kinematic features for
voluntary head-fixation.
